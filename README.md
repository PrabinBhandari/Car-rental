Renting a car 
This is a simple Javascript program that allows a user to find out the cost for the rented car based on the days to rent, miles driven and type of vehicle.
So, first you enter the type of vehicle.
Then you enter the sub-type if available followed by the number of days the car was rented.
After that you enter the total miles driven by that car. At last, the program will give you the brief information of amount to charge from the customer.
